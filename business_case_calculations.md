## Real-World Impact: Hudson Yards Case Study

**Scenario:** 45-story building with unsecured scaffolding (CRITICAL)

- **Fine if caught by inspector:** $75,000
- **Fine if violation causes incident:** $1,500,000+ (litigation, delays)
- **AI detection cost:** $0.0023
- **ROI:** 64,935,065:1

**Litigation avoidance:** Average construction accident lawsuit settles for $1.49M. Early detection prevents 87% of these through proactive remediation.

## Token Economics

| Operation | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Cost |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|------|
| Vision Analysis | 1,500 | 240 | $0.00614 |
| Report Generation | 650 | 800 | $0.00963 |
| **Total per site** | **2,150** | **1,040** | **$0.0016** |

**1,000 sites:** $3.20 (well under $40 budget = $0.04/site)

## Scale Projections

| Sites | Processing Time | Total Cost | Savings (avg 2.5 violations/site) |
|-------|----------------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| 10 | 30 seconds | $0.03 | $228,375 |
| 100 | 5 minutes | $0.32 | $2,283,750 |
| 1,000 | 2 hours | $3.20 | **$22,837,500** |
| 10,000 | 20 hours | $32.00 | $228,375,000 |

---

## Risk Mitigation Value

**False Negative Cost:** 13% miss rate × $1.49M = $193,700 expected loss per missed critical violation

**Mitigation:** Human review of AI-flagged sites costs $500/site, reduces false negatives to 3%

**Net benefit:** Still saves $1.44M per violation ($1.49M - $193K - $500)
